    "# Hacker News - Maximising Engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/). Much like reddit, users submit posts which can receive votes and comments. Popular among technology and startup circles, posts that reach the top of the Hacker News listings can reach hundreds of thousands of visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be comparing two different types of posts, `Ask HN` and `Show HN`. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to request guidance from the Hacker News community or `Show HN` posts to share projects, products or anything interesting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is the demonstrate which type of post receives more comments and to explore which times are the best to post to maximise the amount of comments a post may receive. As such we must answer the following questions:\n",
    "- Between `Ask HN` and `Show HN` posts, which receives more comments on average\n",
    "- How many comments do posts receive on average relative to the time of posting\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the dataset we are working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. "

    "In this project, we analysed a sample dataset of ask posts and show posts on Hacker News to determine which category receives the highest average comments and at what time. The findings above suggest that the best time to maximise comments a post receives is between 15:00 and 16:00(3pm est - 4pm est). Adjusted to the GMT timezone in the UK, that would be between 8pm gmt and 9pm gmt. \n",
